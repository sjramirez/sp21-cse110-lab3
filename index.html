                        <h2 class="journal-header" id="April4th"><em>Sunday, April 4th 2021</em></h2>
                        <p>So today was Easter Sunday, that means that I was in for a busy day with going to church, hanging out 
                            with family, and on top of my normal school work that needed to be done for the day. 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Things I did for School</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        I did not do too much school work today as I was very preoccupied with other things for the day, 
                                        but I did manage to make some progress on my <em>CSE 101</em> homework as well as watch a lecture 
                                        for <em>CSE 130</em>.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>                                
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Activities I did for fun</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Today was a fun filled day, first I went to our local church for service, and after that, my parents 
                                        and I went and got dunkin doughnuts. Over the last few years it has been steadily growing on us as 
                                        out favorite doghnut shop. After that the rest of my family came over and we had food and hung out 
                                        for the rest of the day.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ul> 
                        </li>
            
                        <li>
                            <h3>Misc.</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                <p>While I was talking to my younger cousin who is a Junior in highschool, he told me that he finally 
                                knew what he wanted to go to school for. He eventually settled on trying to get into the Air Force
                                Academy, and then studying either <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong> or
                                 <strong>Civil Engineering</strong>. This was exciting to hear as he has been unsure of what he 
                                 wanted to do for a while.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Another thing that happened on Sunday was that when we were trying to cook tostones, we tried
                                to use an air fryer but it eneded up burning them and they were not very good. So note to self,
                                just make them the old fashioned way in the pan. <br> For those who are unfarmiliar with what 
                                tostones look like here is an image.

                        <p>There was not much going on today, but I did make the drive back from Riverside to La Jolla as well as drop off
                            my girlfriend's sister at Point Loma.
                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Today I went to <em>Spanish</em> as well as <em>CSE 130</em>.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>
                                            I was also able to start work on my PA for <em>CSE 130</em>
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>
                                            Then finally at night I watched some of the assigned videos I had for <em>Spanish</em>.
                                        </p>

                                            I did not have much time to do hobbies or anything, but the drive back to San Diego with my 
                                            girlfriend and her sister was quite enjoyable.

                                            While on the drive back to my appartment a song I had forgotten I loved came up on the Spotify
                                            playlist and made my day. That song was <em>Hey Jude</em> by the <strong>Beatles</strong>.
                                            Here is a short snippet from that song. </p><br>

                        <p>Today was a day where I was able to be pretty productive in school on top of the fact that I got 
                            some pretty good news.

                                            practice with defense. This is something we have been waiting for for a long time and 
                                            I cannot wait to get back out on the field at tournaments to continue to make plays 
                                            like this.
